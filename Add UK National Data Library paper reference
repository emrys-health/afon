## 📘 Paper Summary (as added to the README)

> **UK National Data Library: Distributed Architecture for Research**  
>  
> This paper, submitted to the Wellcome–ESRC Technical White Paper Challenge, outlines a vision for a National Data Library (NDL) that enhances access to UK public sector datasets using a distributed and secure architecture. The authors argue for the creation of an open, interoperable data protocol akin to what TCP/IP did for the internet.  
>  
> Key proposals include:
> - **Open standards** for data storage
> - **Mechanisms for secure and governed data sharing**
> - **Template-driven cloud infrastructure**
>  
> The paper aims to unify fragmented data systems across research and the public sector to improve data-driven policy and research while maintaining public trust.  
>

## 🔍 Why This Matters

- **Strategic alignment**: The NDL framework aligns closely with the goals of our infrastructure initiatives (e.g., Afon), particularly around interoperable research data access.
- **Architecture inspiration**: It outlines a modular, scalable system architecture using secure cloud collaboration and templated infrastructure.
- **Governance model**: Strong emphasis on trust, transparency, and long-term viability of data systems.

## 📎 Suggested Next Steps

- Evaluate technical components for inclusion in Emrys cloud governance stack.
- Consider the governance framework as a baseline for data-sharing across NHS and research environments.
- Discuss adoption of “data interchange protocol” ideas in current service design planning.
