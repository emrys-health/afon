> **UK National Data Library: Distributed Architecture for Research**  
>  
> This paper, submitted to the Wellcome–ESRC Technical White Paper Challenge, outlines a vision for a National Data Library (NDL) that enhances access to UK public sector datasets using a distributed and secure architecture. The authors argue for the creation of an open, interoperable data protocol akin to what TCP/IP did for the internet.  
>  
> Key proposals include:
> - **Open standards** for data storage
> - **Mechanisms for secure and governed data sharing**
> - **Template-driven cloud infrastructure**
>  
> The paper aims to unify fragmented data systems across research and the public sector to improve data-driven policy and research while maintaining public trust.

## 🔍 Why This Matters

- **Strategic alignment**: As a team we wrote this paper to summarise some of our thinking about the NDL. The NDL framework aligns closely with the goals of our infrastructure initiatives (e.g., Afon), particularly around interoperable research data access.
- **Architecture inspiration**: It outlines a modular, scalable system architecture using secure cloud collaboration and templated infrastructure.
- **Governance model**: Strong emphasis on trust, transparency, and long-term viability of data systems.
